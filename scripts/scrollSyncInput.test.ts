// The effect is identified by what it does — it is the one that reads
// `onscrollsync` — not by where its text starts and stops.
//
// It used to be sliced between `'&& onscrollsync)'` and `'\n\t$effect(() => {'`,
// and both halves of that were the same kind of fragile. The start anchor had
// already drifted once, silently: the original marker spelled the whole guard
// condition, the effect gained an `editorReady &&` term when Monaco moved behind
// a dynamic import, and the slice became empty rather than failing — which is
// what the shortened anchor and its `notEqual(-1)` were added for. The end
// anchor never got that guard, and it depends on the *next* effect being
// tab-indented and spelled `$effect(() => {`; write it any other way and this
// file silently starts asserting about the rest of the component.
